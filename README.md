# Titanic-Suvival-Prediction-Internship-Task-1
This project focuses on developing a detailed data analysis dashboard using Power BI to visualize the survival data of Titanic passengers.
The dashboard offers insights into various factors that affected survival rates, such as gender, passenger class, age, and embarkation point.

The dashboard features the following main visualizations:

Survival by Gender: A visual display of survival rates based on gender. The insights indicate that females had a higher survival rate than males.

Survival by Embarkment: An analysis of survival rates depending on the embarkation point (S=Southampton, C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown). It highlights survival statistics for each embarkation location.

Survival by Class: A visualization showing survival rates across different passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd). First-class passengers had the highest survival rate.

Sum of Survived by Age and Gender: A line graph illustrating the survival count across various age groups and genders, providing insights into the age distribution of survivors.

Survival Rate by Gender: A pie chart representing the percentage of survival rates between males and females, offering a quick visual understanding of gender-based survival statistics.

Controls: Interactive features to filter data based on gender, passenger class, and embarkation point. These allow for dynamic and personalized data exploration.

How to Use? Open the Dashboard: Load the Power BI dashboard file into Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.

Interactivity: Use the controls on the right side to filter data according to specific criteria such as gender, passenger class, and embarkation point. Hover over the visualizations to view detailed data points and insights.

Insights: Analyze the visualizations to gain insights into the factors influencing survival rates on the Titanic. Use the dashboard to support data-driven conclusions and hypotheses.

Data Source: The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly accessible and commonly used for data science projects. It includes passenger details like age, gender, passenger class, and survival status.
